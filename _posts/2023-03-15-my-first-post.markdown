Its been long time since I want to own blog my self. Now its finally here

There is funny story before I starting my own blogging site.

I am Backend Developer at its core. I'm thinking that I have been stagnant in learning recently that I need to learn something to scale myself.

There is few path that I can choose but ultimately settle down with learning front end

Why did I choose that? I dont even know

What I know is I want to resolve the frustation that I had when I had to work with front end stuff during work

Its kinda enraging that even some simple form + css + jquery could take me hours to finish it. Plus its ugly and outdated too

With the recent spike on front end popularity recently, I know I had to atleast dabble in 1 out of billion front end framework out there

To simplify stuff, we come to choose 1 out of top three framework out there which is Angular Vs React Vs Vue

We use react at work but I'm not really fond on how it's being written. Not sure whether our codebase is not good or is something else. Anyway, react is off the list

For vue, I kinda like the framework. The only downside is compared to others, this has the least job opening. Since I dont have a lot of time and want to focus on 1 framework only so I put this on hold

Lastly the Angular, What I like the most about Angular is the consistency on how to do stuff. Plus it work around Typescript by default. The job opening are not bad too. So I've decided to go with this

Sorry got sidetracked, this post are not about front end comparison. Lets get back to the story

Ok so moving on, I've 'Kinda' finish this angular course on udemy. Proud of it and now I want to apply it in real world

But wait what do I want to build? If I successfully build it how do I want to show to the world apart of some repo in github

Long story short, I've decided I want to write the blog in angular however I've no clue about design, UI and stuff like that

Multiple attempt has happened, in short I gave up writing it in angular (probably will write more on this in other post)

Somehow I stumbled upon Jekyll(thing I use to build this site) and somehow able to make it running

Basically that the story(Sorry to dissapoint)

Angular story does not end here. There is more to it in other post

Have a good day!
